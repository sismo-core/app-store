# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Nimblr

## Overview

Nimblr is a Decentralized Insurance Marketplace that combines the benefits of the insurance process with the technological efficiencies of blockchain technology.&#x20;

This technology means insureds, underwriters, actuaries, claims assessors, appraisers, and capital providers work in a decentralized environment. They are paid for their work, rewarded for their participation, and together, as part of the larger Nimblr community, they are building a more robust and secure future.
