# Sismo App Store

Welcome to the [Sismo App Store](https://app-store-resources.sismo.io/), the central hub for discovering all apps built with [Sismo Connect](https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/build-with-sismo-connect/getting-started). 


## Building Applications with Sismo Connect

You have two approaches to start building applications with Sismo Connect:
1. **Templated App**:  Leverage our ready-made templates. Modify the parameters according to your requirements to create your own Sismo Connect application. 
Available templates include:
    - zkForm template: More than just a gated form.
    - zkTelegramBot template: Facilitates privacy-preserving gated telegram group chats.
    - zkDrop template: Simplifies privacy-preserving gated NFT airdrops creation.

2. Custom apps (soon): You will be able to build custom apps

### Configuration

All configurations for templates are located in the [space-configs](./space-configs/) folder.

For example, the [configuration](./space-configs/demo/aave-chan-initiative.ts) for the [aave-chan-initiative](https://demo.apps.sismo.io/aave-chan-initiative/aci-swag) the configuration is setup in this files tree.

The environment variable NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV lets you choose your environment.

To run the application:

```bash
yarn dev
