# ðŸ’¯ Nimblr Scores

Nimblr is in a position of gathering information, researching information, and making the appropriate connections between those data sets. That puts Nimblr in a unique position to provide a trust score for users and project. But, why would anyone want this?&#x20;

You don't have to share your trust score if you don't want. That's fine.&#x20;

However, the goal is to provide the resources necessary for all projects and users to increase their trust score toward a more secure and equitable insurance future.&#x20;

Increasing your trust score also has the benefit of increasing your $NIMBLE rewards and has a positive impact on the premiums paid.&#x20;
