# ðŸ”¦ Premium Exploration

Our innovative premium model is driven by data, research, risk metrics, and some traditional insurance historic modeling. The risks inherent to the smart contract of the protocol or project, the risk associated to the nature of the protocol or project, peer group risk measure, and project or protocol security controls are all included in the data set used to determine an appropriate and profitable premium.

This premium model can learn. It can evolve. And, it can be fed by all of the Nimblrs to ensure that, beyond the initial model, the premium model can scale and grow to all categories of risk.&#x20;
