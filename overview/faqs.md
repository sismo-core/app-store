<summary>What is a decentralized insurance marketplace?</summary>

Nimblr is built on the primitive insurance concept of sharing risk. But, Nimblr is doing so using wildly futuristic tech. All components of the insurance process are decentralized.

This means underwriters, actuaries, claims assessors, appraisers, insureds, and capital providers work in a decentralized environment. Yet, they are paid for their work, rewarded for their participation, and together, as part of the larger Nimblr community, they are building a more robust and secure future.

<summary>(And, why is decentralization important?)</summary>

Um, well - because it is the greatest-est. Duh. OK, OK - more detail:

Decentralization is essential because it removes the intermediary as the ‚Äúhub‚Äù of the insurance system. By doing this, the inefficiency and bloat are drastically reduced, the operating costs are driven down, and the process is much more community-friendly.

Decentralization also creates a more democratized and equitable insurance process by allowing everyone involved to earn rewards and APY.

<summary>What is Nimblr insuring at launch?</summary>

Nimble is starting with coverage for music equipment, partner insurance programs, and smart contract vulnerability and intelligent contract hacks.&#x20;

Beyond this, Nimblr is a Decentralized Insurance marketplace. Nimblr is not an insurance company. Nimblr is also not a defi pool of assets guessing how risky the market is. Instead, Nimblr is a first-of-its-kind, innovative market where insureds can purchase cover by working with decentralized underwriters, actuaries, and many other insurance professionals with tremendous efficiency.

So, what will we insure in the future - you name it, we‚Äôll provide access to the coverage.

<summary>What does it mean to be a ‚Äúnimblr‚Äù ?</summary>

Being a ‚ÄúNimblr‚Äù means being part of the global Nimblr community. Maybe you are purchasing insurance, so you are a Nimblr Insured. Perhaps you are working to support risk pools with your limitless breadth of insurance expertise, so you are a Nimblr Underwriter or maybe Nimblr Actuary. Perhaps you are staking into Nimblr risk pools, making you a Nimblr LP.

Whatever kind of Nimblr you are, we love you. And you are essential. We see you, Nimblrs.

<summary>What is the incentive to provide liquidity to a risk pool?</summary>

Providing liquidity to a risk pool allows LPs access to rewards, increased rewards, APY, and a portion of the premiums paid by the Nimblrs. Also, when you see fit, you can pat yourself on the back to help a group of people equitably find coverage.

<summary>How is Nimblr preventing fraud?</summary>

Preventing may not be the right way to look at this. Mitigating is better. Mitigating means doing our very best to make fraud as minimal as possible. We can't bubblewrap the Nimblr community against all fraud, but we can build a system that drastically reduces it.

We are building this system using AI/ML + Advanced Data Science + Trust Scores + Staking + Community Involvement + Wallet Interactions + Partnerships \[Entersoft, Asset Reality, FBI, Vendible, and more] to ensure that we have done everything possible to mitigate risk.

<details>

<summary>How can we be certain that risk pool funds are secure?</summary>

Nimblr takes security very seriously. We have regular smart contract audits performed with regular penetration testing. We have a CISO relationship that provides updates and security patches regularly. We have partnerships and custody arrangements for our digital assets.

On top of this, we also have layers of capital protection for our members and leverage the same tools we use to mitigate fraud to provide proactive support to our DeFi partners in securing our risk pools.

<summary>Will Nimblr be using staked funds to invest and generate yield?</summary>

Yes. Nimblr [Risk Pools](faqs.md#what-do-you-mean-by-risk-pools-as-a-service) and the Nimblr Common Reserve will participate in staking funds and generating yield. We will do this through secure partnerships, oversight of the Nimblr Community, and transparent risk management guidelines.&#x20;
