# 🏎 Dynamic Insurance Engines

Behind each Risk Pocket and Risk Pool are a set of Dynamic Insurance Engines. A Dynamic Rating Engine, Dynamic Underwriting Engine, and Dynamic Capital Model Engine.&#x20;

These have all been built to take input in a standardized way to avoid the silo'ing of data that exists in the traditional insurance process.&#x20;

What it means in practice is that these engines can dynamically rate policies, rebalance risk pools, and make sense of the tremendous amounts of data that flow through Nimblr. The end result is a dramatic reduction in the operating costs of insurance and that savings is passed to Nimblr users through reduced premiums, cash back, and increased capital rewards.&#x20;

For our corporate and carrier partners, you get the benefit of better rates for your customers and improved efficiency for your operations.&#x20;
