# ðŸª£ Nimblr Risk Pockets

Risk Pockets are the fundamental building blocks of the Nimblr ecosystem. When a user pays premium, it is held in a Risk Pocket.&#x20;

Premiums are based on the risk profile of that Risk Pocket and the insurance class it represents. Every risk pocket is individual and separate.&#x20;

The Watch Collection Risk Pocket is separate from the Spaceship Insurance Risk Pocket. Premiums are not co-mingled. Claims experience of one doesn't impact the claims experience of another.&#x20;

What this creates is a simple and transparent rating structure. And, it creates a system where different risks are diversified; a system where premiums held in the Risk Pocket are used as first line of defense.&#x20;

And since insureds are paying these premiums, they can earn cash back in the event of a year with less claims than anticipated.&#x20;
