# ðŸ¤½ Nimblr Risk Pools

Unlike Risk Pockets, Risk Pools are not segrated by risk type but instead risk profile. In other words, they are aggregate pools of funds that have been provided by Capital Providers.&#x20;

These funds stay in Risk Pools to pay for claims that go above and beyond the expected claims of underlying Risk Pockets.&#x20;

So, capital providers can rest assured that their contributions to claims are secondary and they have the capital security of a diversified insurance risk portfolio.&#x20;

For this extra financial cusion, a percentage of premiums from the underlying Risk Pockets flows to the Capital Providers for the "Cost of Capital".
