### What is Decentralized Insurance

Decentralized Insurance means taking all the important parts of the insurance process and leaving all the inefficiencies and bloat behind. Decentralized Insurance creates a democratized process that allows all parts of the insurance process to be a part of the overall success and profitability of the insurance life-cycle. No more insurance company fighting insured; or insured fighting premium increases; or claims that just don't seem to go the way you expect. Instead, grab the insurance disincentive loop and spin that thing back around. You know, like in Price is Right. Now you have a beautiful INCENTIVE Loop.

It makes sense to dig in a little on what insurance is so we can better understand the true value of Decentralized Insurance.
