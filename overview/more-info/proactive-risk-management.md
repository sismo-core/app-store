# ðŸ¦º Proactive Risk Management

Risk management is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of risks followed by coordination or resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events and/or to maximize the realization of opportunities. Risk management can be broken down into categories. We promise they are beneficial to you - and here's how:&#x20;
