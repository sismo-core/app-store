# ðŸ–± Partner Onboarding

Nimblr's mission is to create a democratized insurance process that brings opportunities and equity to everyone everywhere.&#x20;

Our partners mitigate risk for their users by facilitating participation in a fully decentralized insurance marketplace; bringing insureds, underwriters, actuaries, claims adjusters, and LPs together for a safer, decentralized, community-building, and future-proof insurance process.
