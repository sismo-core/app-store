<summary>Ecosystem Transaction Fees</summary>

All transactions in the Nimble protocol will be charged transaction fees, with the exception of the claims and claims voting transactions. Due to the nature of claims and the importance of a transparent and cooperative claims process, there will not be any fees charged in the claims filing, reporting, and voting processes. However, if Claims Adjuster is needed, fees will be applied.

The transaction fees will range from .1% - .75% depending on the total premiums, transaction amounts, and nature of transactions.

<summary>Withdrawal Transaction Fees</summary>

In the event an insured or LP decides to withdraw their currency prior to the natural end date of their lock and/or contract, a fee will be applied to this withdrawal. This is done to mitigate premature withdrawals of funds that will have negative impacts on the remainder of the community. This fee will be generated and calculated based on the time the capital has been in the pool, the total length of the contract, and the remaining term of the lock. The determination will be based loosely on the current short-rate cancellation tables in the traditional insurance space. At launch, the following will apply:
