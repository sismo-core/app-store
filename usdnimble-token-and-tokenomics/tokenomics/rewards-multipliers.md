### Rewards & Multipliers

A Nimble Rewards Pool is set and tokens are budgeted for Rewards as of initial launch. None of these tokens are mature at launch day and are generated based on the Nimble users participation level, participation type, and contribution/staking amount.

Reward Metrics: EnGauge Metrics will be used to reward those Nimblers that participate to support the community, drive risk pool profitability and are active participants in the decentralized nature of Nimble. Factors include both on-chain activities and off-chain activities.

At launch, this information will be monitored and rewards will be provided retroactively to Nimblers upon token launch.
