### What Can $NIMBLE Do For You?&#x20;

* **Insurance Professional Fees:** Nimble is about community. A community of decentralized insureds, liquidity providers, underwriters, actuaries, claims adjusters, and more. Pay for the great work of your fellow community members using $NIMBLE. If you do not own any $NIMBLE, we will automatically convert fees collected in other currencies into $NIMBLE on the open market to maximize friction-less-ness.
* **Staking:** To become a certified Nimbler requires staking of $NIMBLE. By staking $NIMBLE, youâ€™re granted the opportunity to earn rewards from the special Nimbler Rewards pool as long as you meet all of the eligibility requirements.&#x20;
* **Claims:** Of course, no insurance process would be complete without a well thought out claims process. All Nimblers have the right to vote on a claim related to their risk pool. To do so will require $NIMBLE to vote for the claim. Claims rewards are paid out of the Nimble Rewards Pool.&#x20;
* **Governance:** We believe that a strong community can govern itself better than any intermediary or third party ever could. Use your $NIMBLE to vote on the future of not only your Risk Pool, but the future of the Nimble protocol. Proposals will be published and will relate to the development and expansion of Nimble.
